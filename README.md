## Introduction

gridSculpt is a visual tool that leverages global grid deformations and fine-tuned per-cell adjustments to create dynamic, interactive visualizations. By combining an adaptive grid system with a local shape deformation engine, it enables rich, sculpted effects across any canvas-based project.

## Features

- **Global Transformations:** Define non-flat topologies through spherical, cylindrical, or other transformation domains.
- **Local Sculpting:** Use the cellShape module to “sculpt” individual cells with customizable parameters (sphericity, rotational symmetry, etc.).
- **Innovative Polygonal Encoding:** (Placeholder) A method for encoding and manipulating polygonal data within the grid—enables advanced geometry transformations.
- **Real-Time Interaction:** Immediate feedback on grid deformation through click or drag events.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- A modern web browser
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (if you plan to run build tools or local servers)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
````

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd gridSculpt
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies (if applicable):**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` (or the relevant HTML file) in your web browser.
2. The grid will initialize with default parameters.
3. Interact with the canvas (e.g., click) to create transformation domains and observe local cell sculpting effects.
4. Customize parameters in `main.js` or the modules themselves to experiment with different transformation behaviors.

## Innovations (Polygonal Encoding & More)

This section will detail the unique approaches and algorithms used in gridSculpt. Some highlights include:

- **Polygonal Encoding:** An innovative method for encoding and manipulating polygonal data to enable complex geometry transformations.
- **Advanced Grid Definition:** A custom approach to defining grid cells that supports both global deformation domains and local cell sculpting.

_(You can expand this section with diagrams, code snippets, and detailed explanations as you refine your documentation.)_
